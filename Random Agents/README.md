Here you will find the code and report made for a project in TEK5010.  

Download them all and edit random_agents to test out different scenarios,  
and check their efficiency with different plots  
  
In this gif we see agents moving straight until they hit a wall, another agent, a task is done,  
or they stop following a signal. 3 agents are needed at each task for the task to be solved.  
A signal is sent out, only once, when an agent finds a task, green blinking circle.
