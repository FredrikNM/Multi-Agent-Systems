This is the code. Put everything in a folder, and edit random_agents.py to  
simulate different scenarios. Under we see what happens with 30 agents, doing 25 steps per  
time unit, always 2 task available, 3 agents need to complete a task, signal radius  
400, and signal call off if task is done (agents following a signal gets told the task is done  
so they can start roam again).
